# Prententious Story
This is my attempt at some artsy source code stuff. The idea is that you replace [()<>_.;] with a space in the source code for a story in close to correct English.

This should be hosted on a .io domain for maximum hipster pretentiousness levels. Then and only then should it reach the front page of HackerNews. Then it's beyond pretentious.
